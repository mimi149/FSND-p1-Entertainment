This is my second version of Project 1.

I extended it with something: Inheritance, Sort, UIs (tab, accordion, table, tooltip, popover) 

There are some problems I am trying to improve (still find the way and hope to learn from anybody):

1. There is always this error in my terminal although it works well (Created new window for the index.html file in existing browser session. )

[29572:29572:0423/113030:ERROR:nss_util.cc(819)] After loading Root Certs, loaded==false: NSS error code: -8018 

2. I created styles.css and script.js in css and js folder, but my program doesn't work well when I remove their contents from the file fresh_tomatoes.py. I do not know how I can do that.

3. In the tab of Movies, when I scroll down, the Story Line doesn't work as I expect. The page position doesn't hold and scroll up automatically.

4. Some URL require to be seen directly from youtube, maybe I will replace them.

By the way, I found these pages help me a lot:
